## What I have learned

Definitely I have learned the basics of using framework libraries like Bootstrasp, and I have to say it was a little bit challenging because I am used to styling the sites, I build writing my own CSS. However, it is a practical knowledge to have since it allows you to reduce the time of coding, and there are some amazing things already done in framework libraries or CSS libraries.
